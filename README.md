# CAMSCANNER
It is a document scanner build using opencv, matplotlib, numpy etc... in short MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT
# 📄 Python Document Scanner (CamScanner Clone)

A multi-stage image processing pipeline built with Python and OpenCV to automatically detect, crop, and enhance documents from an image, replicating the functionality of applications like CamScanner.

## 🌟 About The Project

The goal of this project is to create an algorithm that can take a photograph of a document taken at an angle and transform it into a clean, top-down, and enhanced "scanned" image. This involves a pipeline of computer vision techniques to identify the document's boundaries, correct its perspective, and improve its readability.

### 🎯 Key Features

*   **Automatic Document Detection:** Finds the largest quadrilateral contour in an image, assuming it is the document.
*   **Perspective Correction:** Warps the detected document region into a flat, top-down view.
*   **Image Enhancement:** Applies a series of filters to improve the contrast, brightness, and sharpness of the final scanned image.
*   **Built entirely with Python, OpenCV, and NumPy within a Jupyter Notebook.**

## ⚙️ The Processing Pipeline

The document scanning process is broken down into several distinct stages:

**1. Grayscale Conversion & Blurring**
*   The input image is first converted to grayscale, as color information is not needed for edge detection.
*   A **Gaussian Blur** is applied to the grayscale image to smooth it and reduce high-frequency noise, which helps in achieving a more accurate edge detection.

**2. Canny Edge Detection**
*   The **Canny edge detector** is used on the blurred image to identify the boundaries of the document. This algorithm is effective at finding sharp changes in intensity.

**3. Contour Detection and Filtering**
*   `cv2.findContours` is used to find all closed shapes in the edge map.
*   The contours are sorted by area in descending order, and the largest one is assumed to be the document.
*   The contour is approximated to a polygon. If this polygon has exactly four vertices, it is identified as the target document outline.

**4. Perspective Transformation**
*   Once the four corners of the document are identified, a **perspective transform** is calculated using `cv2.getPerspectiveTransform`.
*   This transformation matrix is then applied to the original image using `cv2.warpPerspective` to obtain a corrected, top-down view of the document.

**5. Final Image Enhancement**
*   To make the final output look like a high-quality scan, a multi-step enhancement process is applied:
    *   **Gamma Correction:** Subtly brightens the image and enhances mid-tone contrast.
    *   **Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE):** The image is converted to the LAB color space, and CLAHE is applied to the Luminance (L) channel to improve local contrast without over-amplifying noise.
    *   **Saturation & Sharpness Boost:** The image is further refined by boosting color vibrancy and applying a sharpening filter to enhance text clarity.

## 📊 Results

The pipeline successfully transforms a raw photograph of a document (`images/example.jpg`) into a clean, flat, and highly readable scanned version (`result images/final.jpg`).

Below is a direct comparison of the input and the final enhanced output.

### Before vs. After

| Before: Original Photo (`images/example.jpg`) | After: Final Enhanced Scan (`result images/final.jpg`) |
| :-------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------: |
|  ![Original Document Image](images/example.jpg)   | ![Final Scanned Document](result%20images/final.jpg) |

This transformation is achieved through the multi-step processing pipeline detailed above. The final output is correctly oriented, free of perspective distortion, and features enhanced contrast, making the text sharp and legible.
